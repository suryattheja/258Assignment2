For each article, the GuardianFeatures.csv and the NYTFeatures.csv contain feature vectors. The features embedded in these vectors are:
  - Lenght of article
  - Count of punctuations
  - Count of misspells
  - Sentiment analysed using NLTK
  - Count of superlatives
  - Count of adjectives
  - Average word lenghts
  - Count of ! marks
 We proceed to apply classification algorithms using the above as features.
