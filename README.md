# Fake-news-detection
Datasets and algorithm to implement a classifier to detect fake news. 
Input: News article of any length.
Output: True or false, with false meaning positive for fake news.

**While the training algorithm itself is invariant to the nature of news articles, it MUST be trained for a specific topic and a specific time period using articles from the same topic and time period**
Classification implemented using:
TF-IDF, Logistic regression on numerical features and Convolutional neural networks.

Also contains a report compiled in ACM format. 
The Feature engineering folder contains vectorized forms of features extracted for each article, upon which classification is applied.
